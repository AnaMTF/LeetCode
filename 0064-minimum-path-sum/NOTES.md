Approach:
​
The code implements a dynamic programming approach to find the minimum path sum in a grid.
​
The algorithm uses a 2D array to store the minimum path sum to reach each position (i, j) in the grid, where i represents the row and j represents the column.
​
The minimum path sum to reach each position (i, j) is computed by taking the minimum of the path sum to reach the position above (i-1, j) and the position to the left (i, j-1), and adding the cost of the current position (i, j).
​
The minimum path sum to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid is stored in the last element of the array (grid[m-1][n-1]), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns in the grid.
​
Intuition:
​
The intuition behind the dynamic programming approach is that the minimum path sum to reach a position (i, j) in the grid can be computed by considering the minimum path sum to reach the positions (i-1, j) and (i, j-1).
​
This is because the only two possible ways to reach the position (i, j) are either by moving down from (i-1, j) or moving right from (i, j-1).
​
By computing the minimum path sum to reach each position in the grid, the algorithm can find the minimum path sum to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid by simply looking at the last element of the array (grid[m-1][n-1]).
