We try to find a solution in a greedy way. We iterate over nums and first check if the current value at index i is smaller than the previous found firstValue. Now if we next find a value at index i that is larger than the firstValue but smaller than the current secondValue we can set secondValue to the current value at index i. Now we have found the first and the second number. If the next value at index i is larger than the secondValue (and of course also as the firstValue)we have found an increasing triplet and return true.
Now let's look at a case that maybe confuses you. Let's say we have nums = [10,12,5,13]. If we run our algorithm on this problem we see that at index position 2, 5 is smaller than the current firstValue and thus firstValue = 5. Now we have a firstValue that comes after the secondValue which doesn't make sense. To find the answer to the question if there is an increasing triplet that doesn't matter, because we are sure that previous to the secondValue there is a smaller value, because otherwise we would not have gotten a secondValue smaller than ÌNT_MAX and thus there would be no possibility to find a third value larger than the second value. So in our example although firstValue = 5 which does not correspond to the first value of the found increasing triplet, we are sure that there is an increasing triplet because secondValue = 12 and to even get the second value there must have been a smaller first value before which was 10.
